We do most of our at BYU OIT inside an "inner zone" that you can only get to while connected to a VPN network. It's annoying to have to remember to VPN in and some strange errors happen when you try to do something without access to a server. This fixes that by auto-prompting that you reconnect whenever your connection dies.

Set as a login item to always ensure that you're connected. Works on Mac OS X and tested on Yosemite.

You can modify the script in Script Editor.app if you need to autoconnect to a different VPN.
